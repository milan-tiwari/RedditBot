Thank you for the honest input.  That was kind of my fear. It's just so hard to find a place that ticks at least a few of the boxes I want and isn't $$$$$$ for a shitty shack. Good luck in your next adventure! :)
OK, so I shouldn't come because you hate locals. 

Got it, just the mentality I am trying to avoid.

Thanks for the input! I live in Ohio, and I have noticed that many southern cities here and in WV, NC, SC have signs at their businesses. I hate that. I am trying to avoid that sort of stuff, would love to leave the country, but that is not possible right now. :)
